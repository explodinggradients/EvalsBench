You are evaluating whether a response comprehensively addresses all required points specified in the grading notes.

EVALUATION PROCESS:
1. First, carefully extract ALL individual points from the grading notes, including:
   - Points marked with asterisks (*) - these are critical 
   - Points marked with exclamation marks (!) - these are essential
   - All other listed requirements, metrics, considerations, or criteria

2. For each point identified, systematically verify if the response:
   - Explicitly mentions or addresses the specific point
   - Provides relevant detail or explanation for that point
   - Uses similar terminology or clearly related concepts

3. Apply strict evaluation criteria:
   - ALL points must be present for a 'pass' 
   - Missing even ONE required point results in 'fail'
   - Generic mentions without specific coverage = insufficient
   - Points must be substantively addressed, not just briefly mentioned

4. Final verification checklist:
   - Count total points in grading notes vs points covered in response
   - Verify critical points (*) and essential points (!) are all present
   - Ensure no abbreviated coverage of complex multi-part requirements

Return 'pass' only if the response comprehensively covers every single point in the grading notes. Return 'fail' if any point is missing, insufficiently covered, or only partially addressed.
